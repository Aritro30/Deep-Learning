# Deep-Learning

The purpose of this assignment is to get introduced to deep learning. Specifically, the assignment consists of three parts:

First Part - Implement various PyTorch deep learning layers using Numpy; 
Second Part - Experiment with different hyper-parameters on a image classification task and find the best hyper-parameters.
Third Part -  Investigate a state-of-the-art neural architecture from the PyTorch model zoo.
